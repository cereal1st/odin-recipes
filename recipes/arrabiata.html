    <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 pound penne</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li> 6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li> 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> Optional: 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving </li>
            <li> Optional: Fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
            
        </ul>
   
    <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the penne pasta and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
